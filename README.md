# Who-would-win-the-Olympics

This is my side project inspired by a course from my school. This is the first time I worked with Pandas, Scikit Learn and many machine learning algorithms.

My project aims to train a model predicting an athlete would get which medals based on his physical chacteristics.
In my project, I tried different models and ways of preprocessing data in order to find out the best combination.


Data used in the project can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results.
